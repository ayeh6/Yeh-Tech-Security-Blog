                  I am a first generation college graduate from Modesto, California. Earned my Bachelor's in Computer
                  Science and Engineering at the University of California, Merced in May 2019 and earned a certificate
                  of completion in Full Stack Web Development at the University of California, Berkeley in October 2022.
                  I also have a big interest in cybersecurity, because of that I am learning cybersecurity skills at
                  University of California, Berkeley currently. I prefer the backend of code where I am able to create
                  and manipulate data and implement CRUD features, but also secure them too and making sure that there
                  are no points of exploitation when creating APIs. I hope to pursue a career somewhere in web and
                  application services whethe it be development or security.

               <p class="card-text">I recently made an impulse amazon purchase of a AVHzY CT-3 USB tester. Initially saw
                  it from
                  a youtube
                  video and at the time it was sold out because of the hype. Now it's finally in stock I acquired one
                  and
                  it is great! I am able to test my chargers and see which protocols they are able to fast charge with
                  like
                  samsung/apple fast charging, quick charge 3.0 or 2.0, and many other protocols. It even has an e-mark
                  chip reader so if you have a usb-c cable with an e-mark chip, you can test to see what the cable is
                  capable of in terms of speed and charging capabilities.</p>

               <p class="card-text">I finally got a FlipperZero! It is such a neat tool to use, so far I have been using
                  it as a universal remote for my fan and air purifier, but it can do a lot of other things. I was able
                  to import a bunch of amiibos onto it so it's a universal amiibo. It is also fun to just scan random
                  things that have NFC capabilities and see what information is hidden. As far as sub-ghz I have only
                  copied my garage opener and it seems to be finicky when it comes to it being reliable on that signal
                  for some reason.</p>
